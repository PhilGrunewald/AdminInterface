[Meter] Brief project update
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">Meter project</a>. 
   
While you are waiting for your trial day, you might like to know what is happening with the project. Here are some highlights:
</br>
<ul>
	<li>Over 400 households registered within weeks of launching the project</li>
	<li>So far we collected over 6 million electricity readings (nearly 2000 hours worth)</li>
	<li>1250 activities have been translated from booklets to the database, with lots more in progress</li>
	<li>We are in the final stages of testing an app, which will make activity recording much easier</li>
	<li>A visualisation is being developed to allow you to explore your profile and activities</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can read more about this in the attached <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/files/MeterReading2.pdf">Meter Reading</a>.

If you have any questions about the project, please do not hesitate to email me.

<p>
Many thanks and kind regards,</br>
