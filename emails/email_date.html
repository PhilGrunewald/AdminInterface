[Meter] Please select a new date for your study 
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>After you agreed to take part in the <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">Meter study</a> on <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">energy-use.org</a>, we sent a confirmation e-mail but did not receive your confirmation in time to send you your parcel.</p> 

We have paused over the Christmas holiday, but we would still appreciate your participation. Please follow  
<a href="http://www.energy-use.org/date.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]">this link</a> to to see if any of our January dates will work for you.
</p><p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
We will send you a parcel with an electricity recorder, which is very easy to attach to your mains electricity meter. We also give everyone in your household an activity recorder. With a few simple clicks you can tell us about the main things you do throughout this one day. When done, you post everything back to us in a pre-paid envelope and we will send you a visualisation of your activities and electricity use. <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php"> Find out more here. </a>
</p>
<h3>Your right to withdraw</h3>
<p>
Participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time and have your records deleted, simply by emailing. Or you can <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/unsubscribe.php?id=[id]">unsubscribe here</a>.
</p><p>
We do, of course, hope that you will <a href ="http://www.energy-use.org/register.php">help us with this important research</a>. There is also a chance to win a year free electricity.
</p><p>
Please contact me with any questions you may have.

Kind regards<br>
