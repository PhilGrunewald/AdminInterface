[Meter] Update
Dear [name],
Thank you very much for taking part in the Meter project and for completing your diary so thoroughly on [date].

You have now been entered into the prize draw to win a year free electricity and we will inform you about the outcome before the end of the year.

I am sorry to inform you that the electricity recorder did not function properly. This is quite rare and nothing you have done wrong. As these are very early days in the study we hope to iron out these issues. Your diary data is still very valuable for this study.

I see that you chose not to take part again. If you change your mind, just click the link below and I very much hope that next time the electricity reading will work properly.

I do apologise for not being able to share your load profile with you.

Kind regards,
Phil
