[Meter] Your 2nd profile and round 3
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>Thank you for a great effort last week. Yesterday you should have received your pack for the 3rd of our 4 days. This time everything is back to normal. No need to avoid electricity use or do anything special.
</p><p>
Please remember to attach the clip before Sunday at 5pm when we begin the recording.
</p><p>
To see your profile from [date],
<a href="http://www.energy-use.org/street/?id=[householdID]"> follow this link: www.energy-use.org/street/?id=[householdID]</a>
</p><p>
Alongside your own profile (green area) you can see the average in your neighbourhood (black line). 
The bottom graph allows you to see 6 hours in more detail. Click and drag this to the sides to explore the full 28 hours.
</p><p>If you own PV you will notice that your exports appear as demand - we will take account of that. 
</p><p>
Thank you very much for your help with this study,</br>
<i>Your Meter Team</i>
