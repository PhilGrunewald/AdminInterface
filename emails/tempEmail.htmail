[Meter] Your study participation on Tue, 24 Jan
<p>Dear Roxanne Connelly,</p>
<p>
I am really sorry to hear that you parcel did not arrive in time. We had one other participant on the same day who had the same problem - there must have been an issue with Royal Mail.
</p>
<p>
I hope we can find a day for you to give it another go.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks and kind regards,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
