[Meter] Do you still have your recorder from [date]?
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
The year is coming to an end and we try to take stock of our equipment.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible that you still have an electricity recorder from us? We try to reuse these units and if you still have yours, could you send it back to us?
</p>
<p>
If you no longer have it, please be so kind and let us know, so that we can update our record and won't bother you again.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, we will send you a parcel with a return envelope in the next week to</p> 
<p>
[address]
</p>
<p>
Many thanks and kind regards,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
