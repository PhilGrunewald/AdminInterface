[Meter] Thank you for your patience
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>When you registered for the <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">Meter project</a> on <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">energy-use.org</a>, we said that we would find a date for you in due course. Thank you for waiting so patiently.
</p>
<p>
The response to our study has been so positive, that we still have a long waiting list. Over the summer we have been working to increase our capacity. Two interns have made great contributions and soon we hope to be able to launch our app, which will complement the booklets and make the recording of activities much easier. Once this app is fully tested we hope to be able to offer you a date to finally take part.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about this app and the project in the attached <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/files/MeterReading2.pdf">Meter Reading</a>.

<p>
Thank you for your patience. If you have any questions about the project, please do not hesitate to email me.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks and kind regards,</br>
