[Meter] Update
Dear [name],

We have just sent you your parcel for your Meter day on [date].

I hope you enjoy taking part. For a reminder of what is involved, do visit http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php. Just to manage expectations, it may take some time before we can return your activity information. The electricity readings are much quicker to process and should be with you a few days after you return the parcel in the pre-paid envelope.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

Kind regards,
Phil
