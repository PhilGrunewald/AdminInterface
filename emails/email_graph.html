[Meter] Final round
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>We really appreciate your contribution to this study. This is the final round!
</p><p>
This time we ask you once again to try to use less electricity for 2 hours - from 5pm to 7pm on Monday. 
</p><p>
After this round, please be so kind and drop the recorders in the white envelope in a postbox. They are pre-paid - no postage required.
If that is inconvenient, please email me and we come and collect.
</p><p>
<h3>Celebration</h3>
25 Sep. 6-7pm at OUCE, OX1 3QY
</p><p>
You are invited to join us for a post-study celebration, where we will share results and announce the winners. This is also a chance for us to learn from you how the study went, which parts you felt worked well and how we can do better.
Please tell us how many of you would like to attend, so that we can arrange the catering.
