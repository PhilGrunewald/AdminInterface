[Meter] Your electricity profile from [date]
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>Thank you for your time to help with the METER study on [date] and for returning the equipment so promptly. You have now been entered into the prize draw with a chance to win a year free electricity. We will inform you about the outcome before the end of the year.
</p><p>
You can view your load profile via this link:</br>

</p><p>
We are still working on the activity information you provided. Please bear with us - this could take some time. 
</p><p>
The profile can give you a sense of the times of day when you use most electricity. You may also like to look out for the 'baseload' - that is the minimum amount recorded and often represents stand-by appliances. If you have questions about your use or you would like to comment, please email me.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks and kind regards,</br>
