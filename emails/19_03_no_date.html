<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>When you signed up for the Meter study with the University of Oxford, we said we'd follow up with suitable dates for you. Apologies it has taken so long. We've had a bit of a backlog.
</p><p>
We now have new dates available for you to take part:<br>
<a href="http://www.energy-use.org/date.php?hh=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]">
<img src="http://www.energy-use.org/img/pick_a_date.png" alt="pick a date at http://www.energy-use.org/date.php?hh=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]" width="150px" height="40px" align="top">
</a>
</p><p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/app/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]&pg=1">update your survey information here</a>.
</p><p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
We will send you a parcel with an electricity recorder, which is very easy to attach to your mains electricity meter. We also give everyone in your household an activity recorder. With a few simple clicks you can tell us about the main things you do throughout this one day. When done, you post everything back to us in a pre-paid envelope and we will send you a visualisation of your activities and electricity use. <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php"> Find out more here. </a>
</p>
Many thanks and kind regards,
</p> <p>
