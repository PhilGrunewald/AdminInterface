Broimum - miles of death sone 

Vanadium - ~20Wh per litre

Cell voltage 1.4 V
(limited by electrolysis 1.23V limit)

8 hour system

- electrolyte 35% of cost

- Power:
  Membrane 10.8%

target 35Wh/l (LiIon 300Wh/l, petrol 10,000Wh/l)
$100/kWh

aqueous material is cheap

non-aqueous - acida nitrile - is expensive but cheaper than vanadium

need occasional regeneration to undo crossover

Culoumb efficiency 85%, energy efficiency 60%

Chromium
Manganese
Vanadium

All organiv flow battery - replace Vanadium with "diphenylanthracene

V2O5 £134 £/kWh
DPA £2kWh
