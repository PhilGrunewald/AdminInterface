[Meter] Can we offer you a new date instead of [date]?
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>When you signed up for the <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">Meter study</a> on <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">energy-use.org</a>, you selected <b>[date]</b> as the best day for you. We did not receive your confirmation in time to send you your parcel. Would it it be at all possible to ask you to pick a new date in January?</p>
</p>
If so, <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/date.php?hh=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]"> please pick a date via this link</a>.

</p><p>
If your address has changed, please <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]&pn=1">update your address here</a>.
</p><p>
You do not have to redo any other part of your household survey - simply close the browser when you are done.

</p><p>
I do apologise for this further delay - we found that mail deliveries during the Christmas period can be a little slower and we want to make sure the parcel gets to you for the right day.
</p><p>

Many thanks and kind regards,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
