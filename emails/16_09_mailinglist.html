[Meter] Brief project update
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
I wanted to give you a brief update about the <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">Meter project</a>. We are nearly one year in and a lot has happened.
</p>
<p>
Here are some highlights:
</br>
<ul>
	<li>Over 400 households registered within weeks of launching the project in May</li>
	<li>So far we collected over 6 million electricity readings (nearly 2000 hours worth)</li>
	<li>1250 activities have been translated from booklets to the database, with lots more in progress</li>
	<li>We are looking for a <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/meter.php">Data Scientist</a> to join us (Deadline 14 Oct). Please share with people who might enjoy this.</li>
	<li>The app is in the final stages of testing. It will make activity recording and coding significantly easier.</li>
	<li>A visualisation interface is under development. This will allow you to explore electricity profiles and activities.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The attached <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/files/MeterReading2.pdf">"Meter Reading"</a> gives a summary of the recent activities and explains how the app works.
</p>
<p>
We will be hosting a second 'Expert Workshop' in late November/early December. If you are keen to attend, please let me know and tell me whether there are dates we should avoid.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
