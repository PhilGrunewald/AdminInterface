[Meter] Your pack for the West Oxford Energy Street Challenge
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
We just delivered your pack for the Oxford Energy Street Challenge. Please take the time to read the brief instructions. You can attach the electricity recorder right away.
</p><p>
Feel free to practice with the activity recorders ahead of time. The actual study period is from <br/>
5pm on Sunday until<br> 
9pm on Monday.
</p><p>
Please note that you don't have to do anything special on this day (there may be challenges on future days...). Just report your normal activities - at home or away.
</p><p>
We can collect the recorders on Tuesday evening, if that is convenient for you. Or email us for another time. Alternatively you can drop the recorders with Marina on 34 West Street.
</p><p>
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.
<p>
Kind regards,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
