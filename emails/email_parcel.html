[Meter] Your package for [date] is on its way
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
We have just sent you your parcel for your Meter day on [date].
</p><p>
I hope you enjoy taking part. For a reminder of what is involved, see <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php">how it works here</a>.
</p><p>
A few days after you return the equipment in the pre-paid envelope you will receive your electricity profile of the day. The activity information might take a little longer for us to process - please bear with us.
</p><p>
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
<p>
Kind regards,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
