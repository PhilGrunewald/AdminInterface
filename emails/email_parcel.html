[Meter] Your parcel for [date] is on its way
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
Your parcel is in the post. When it arives, please take the time to read the brief instructions and you can attach the electricity recorder immediately.
</p><p>
You can also practice with the activity recorders ahead of time. The actual study period is from 5pm on [date] until 9pm the following day.

</p><p>
We hope you enjoy taking part. For a reminder of what is involved, see <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php">how it works here</a>.
</p><p>
A few days after you returned the equipment in the pre-paid envelope you will receive your electricity profile of the day.
</p><p>
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.
<p>
Kind regards,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
