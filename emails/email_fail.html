[Meter] Your electricity profile from [date]
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for taking part in the Meter study and for completing your diary so thoroughly on [date].

You have now been entered into the prize draw to win a year free electricity and we will inform you about the outcome before the end of the year.

I am sorry to inform you that the electricity recorder did not function properly on this occasion. This doesn't mean that you did anything wrong - sadly this can sometimes happen. Please be assured that your efforts and your diary data are still very valuable for the research we conduct.
I appreciate that this must be disappointing for you. If you are willing to give it another go, you are very welcome to
