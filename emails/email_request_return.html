[Meter] Your return parcel
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
When we checked our records it looked as if we haven't got your recorders from [date].
</p> <p>
Is it possible that you still have them? If you weren't able to fill them in, that is absolutely no problem. 
</p> <p>
If you still have the electricity and activity recorders, could you please be so kind to send them back to us? We only have a limited number and try to reuse them to keep the cost down.
</p> <p>
I can send you one of the white free-post envelopes to:
</p> <p>
[address]
</p>
<p>
I hope this is the correct address.
</p>
<p>
Should we have made a mistake and you already returned everything, please accept my apologies. Please let us know and we can update our records.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks and kind regards,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
