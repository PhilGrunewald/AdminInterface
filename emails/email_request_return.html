<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>
Did you receive your parcel in time for [date]? I very much value your feedback. Please let me know if there were any issues that we should address to make the process easier for you.

Have you already posted the electricity recorder back to us? If not, please be so kind and put it in the white pre-paid envelope and drop it in a letterbox. We can send you another return envelope if you like.

<p>
The address we sent the equipment to was:</br>
