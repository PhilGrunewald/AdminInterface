<h3>We have a winner... </h3>

Winter can be the toughest time for our electricity grid. Demand often reaches its all year peak on one of these days at around 6pm. But there is some good news:  over Christmas itself national consumption turns out to be comparatively low. So do enjoy your lights without fear of pushing the system over the edge.
</p>
<h3>Next year </h3> 
<p> 
It has been a terrific first year for the Meter study. Data keeps streaming in and we are beginning to build up a fascinating picture of the sheer diversity of our activities and related electricity use patterns. Not long and we can start sharing first results.</p> 
<p>
In the coming year we hope to learn more about what we can do to avoid electricity use during those most problematic times. I hope you will be able to help us. Until then, do enjoy the festive period and the Christmas lights.
