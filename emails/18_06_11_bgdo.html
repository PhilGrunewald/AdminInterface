[Meter] Welcome and thank you for taking part
<p>Dear [name],</p>
</p><p>
Thank you so much for expressing your interest in our research on household electricity use during Oxford's Big Green Day Out on Broad Street.
</p><p>
You can now 
 <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]">
take part yourself (click here).
</a>
</p><p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
About a week before your chosen day, we will email you to confirm your address and that you are ready to receive your parcel. In this parcel you will find an electricity recorder, which is very easy to attach to your mains electricity meter. We also give everyone in your household an activity recorder. With a few simple clicks you can tell us about the main things you do throughout this one day. When done, you post everything back to us in a pre-paid envelope and we will send you a visualisation of your activities and electricity use. <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php"> Find out more here. </a>
</p>
<h3>Your right to withdraw</h3>
<p>
Participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time and have your records deleted, simply by emailing us or <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/unsubscribe.php?id=[id]">unsubscribe here</a>.
</p><p>
We do, of course, hope that you will help us with this important research by <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]">taking part</a>. There is also a chance to win a year free electricity.
</p><p>
Please contact me with any questions you may have.
</p><p>
Kind regards<br>
