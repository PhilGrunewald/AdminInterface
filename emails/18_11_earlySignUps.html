[Meter] We haven't forgotten you [ test ]
<p>Dear [name],</p>
</p><p>
You were among the very first to sign up for the <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">Meter study</a> on UK household electricity use.
</p><p>
We have had such a positive response, that many haven't been able to take part yet. Now is your chance.
</p><p>
Before we can send you your electricity and activity recorders, please 
<a href ="http://www.energy-use.org/register.php">click through a few questions</a>, so that we have the correct address for you and some information about your household and which date suits you best to take part. This should only take about 3 minutes.

</p><p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
We will email you before sending you the parcel. In this parcel you will find an electricity recorder, which is very easy to attach to your mains electricity meter. We also give everyone in your household an activity recorder. With a few simple clicks you can tell us about the main things you do throughout this one day. When done, you post everything back to us in a pre-paid envelope and we will send you a visualisation of your activities and electricity use. <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php"> Find out more here. </a>
</p>
<h3>Your right to withdraw</h3>
<p>
Participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time and have your records deleted, simply by emailing us or <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/unsubscribe.php?id=[id]">unsubscribe here</a>.
</p><p>
We do, of course, hope that you will <a href ="http://www.energy-use.org/register.php">help us with this important research</a>. There is also a chance to win a year free electricity.
</p><p>
Please contact me with any questions you may have.
</p><p>
Kind regards<br>
