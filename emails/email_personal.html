<p>Dear Phil,</p>
<p>
	We have made a little animation for our Meter study participants and I did not want to withhold it from you. I hope you do not find it to incite energy profligacy - it is meant to put an informative twist on the unusual (and for some unexpected) fact that Boxing Day is a day of low, rather than high consumption (well, in electricity terms at least).
</p> <p>
I hope you like it.
</p> <p>
We have now field tested the activity app and the responses were very positive. I am sitting on a pile of 100 phones with it pre-installed and look forward to sending them out in the New Year.
</p> <p>
Thank you for all your help and support. I hope to pay you back with data in 2017.
