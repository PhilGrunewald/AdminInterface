<p>Dear Alan,</p>
<p>
Good news - you can now take part in the Meter Study. (It has been some time - just to jog your memory, you completed the survey on <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">energy-use.org</a>)
</p>
<p>
See if there is a good day for you <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/date.php?hh=8440&sc=123">here</a>. We will then send you a personal electricity recorder and our <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php"> new activity recorders</a> for everyone in your home above the age of eight. They make recording your activities much more fun than the old paper diaries.
</p>
<p>
I hope to be sending them to you soon,</br>
<i>Phil</i>
