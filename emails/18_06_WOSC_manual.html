[Meter] West Oxford Energy Street Challenge - action required
<p>Dear [name],</p>
</p><p>
Thank you so much for taking part in the West Oxford Energy Street Challenge.
</p><p>
So that we can give you the right number of activity recorders, please go through this 
 <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]">
simple survey (click here)
</a>
. This should not take more than 3 minutes and will help us with our research.
</p><p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
In the next few days we will give you a pack. In it you will find an electricity recorder, which is very easy to attach to your mains electricity meter. We also give everyone in your household (above the age of 8) an activity recorder. With a few simple clicks you can tell us about the main things you do during one day.

</p><p>
You can be at home or away on this day - treat it as you would normally go about your day. Randomly, you may find special instructions in your pack - see if you can respond to those.
</p><p>
When done, we collect the devices and send you a visualisation of your activities and electricity use. <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php"> Find out more here. </a>
</p>
<h3>Your right to withdraw</h3>
<p>
Participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time and have your records deleted, simply by emailing us. Or <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/unsubscribe.php?id=[id]">unsubscribe here</a> to not hear from us again.
</p><p>
We do, of course, hope that you will help us with this important research by <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]">completing the survey</a>. Aside from prizes for your street, there is also a chance to win a year free electricity.
</p><p>
Please contact me with any questions you may have.
</p><p>
Kind regards<br>
