[Meter] Your profile and round 2
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>Today you should have received your pack for the 2nd round starting this Sunday at 5pm.
</p><p>
This is where the fun starts: on Monday from 5pm-7pm we ask you to try and reduce your electricity use - within reason. We look forward to hearing from you how you went about it.
</p><p>
To see your profile from [date],
<a href="http://www.energy-use.org/street/?id=[householdID]"> follow this link: www.energy-use.org/street/?id=[householdID]</a>
</p><p>
Alongside your own profile (green area) you can see the average in your neighbourhood (black line). Click on the colourful squares to see the activities you reported. Do not take the absolute values too seriously - these recorders are known to be good for relative comparisons, but not for precision (to do with power factors - for the electrical engineers...)
</p><p>
The bottom graph allows you to see 6 hours in more detail. Click and drag this to the sides to explore the full 28 hours.
</p><p>
We look forward to seeing how next week will differ. After that you have two more chances.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for your help with this research,</br>
<i>Your Meter Team</i>
