[Meter] Please help us again in 2018
<p>Dear [name],</p>
</p><p>
You were among the first to help us develop the Meter Study by filling in a diary for one day, while we recorded your electricity use.
</p><p>
This study is now in full flow and we would very much like to invite you to 
<a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]&pn=17">take part again</a>.
</p><p>
It is now easier that ever. We developed an <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php">activity recorder</a>, which we will send you to track what you do with a few simple clicks. We hope you will enjoy the process.
</p><p>
We also encourage you to invite friends, family and neighbours to register at 
<a href="http://www.energy-use.org">energy-use.org</a>. If more than 3 people mention your name as having referred them, we will enter you in a special draw to win a year free electricity.
</p><p>
Last year the costs of solar PV and wind energy continued to drop at spectacular rates. With this research we can help to understand how the timing of our need for electricity can be best matched with these new resources for a cleaner and cheaper energy future.
</p><p>
Please help us and 
<a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]&pn=17">take part</a>.
</p><p>
Kind regards<br>
