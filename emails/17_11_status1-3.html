[Meter] Please take part in Oxford study to help reduce UK energy bills
<p>Dear [name],</p>
</p><p>
When you signed up for the <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">Meter study</a> on <a href="http://www.energy-use.org">energy-use.org</a>, we promised to find a suitable day for you. The wait is over. The study is now in full swing and we are delighted to offer you a fresh set of dates.
Take a <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]&pn=17"> look at these dates</a> and pick the best one for you.
</p><p>
<h3>Aims of the study</h3>
<p>
We are facing rising energy bills, despite dramatic cost reductions for renewable energy. If we got the timing of electricity use to better match the output of renewables, the cost of electricity generation could be substantially reduced. The UK Government believes that up to £40bn could be saved through a combination of smart solutions, such as storage and flexible demand.
With our research we try to better understand the timing of electricity use. <i>When</i> and <i>for what</i> do we need electricity the most? 
</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
About a week before your chosen day, we will email you to confirm your address and that you are ready to receive your parcel. In this parcel you will find an electricity recorder, which is very easy to attach to your mains electricity meter. We also give everyone in your household an activity recorder. With a few simple clicks you can tell us about the main things you do throughout this one day. When done, you post everything back to us in a pre-paid envelope and we will send you a visualisation of your activities and electricity use. <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/how_it_works.php"> Find out more here. </a>
</p>
<h3>Your right to withdraw</h3>
<p>
Participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time and have your records deleted, simply by emailing us.
</p><p>
We do, of course, hope that you will help us with this important research by <a href="http://www.energy-use.org/hhq.php?id=[householdID]&sc=[securityCode]&pn=17">taking part</a>. There is also a chance to win a year free electricity.
</p><p>
Please contact me with any questions you may have.
</p><p>
Kind regards<br>
